"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995.  At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on premise servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code. Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.

Enter the Progressive Web Applications (PWA). A technology stack that utilizes the web browser as the ultimate runtime environment. You can run your application so long as a web browser is on the device. This is the same mantra and spirit of the original Java slogan.

The goal of this project is to aid software engineers in building and delivering on PWAs. It will implement a series of identified use cases across the different identified SDK technologies to support all aspects of a PWA. The later sections of this document will expand on this philosophy.

# Features

The following identifies the use cases that will make up the module and the design paradigm of the modules. Not all use cases are implemented in each module as they will not apply to that module's SDK environment.

# Version

The following documents the version of this document and explains the *CodeMelted Module* versioning scheme.

## Document

**01 Jan 2024:**
- Updated the use case model to reflect a better breaking down of the modules into four areas rather then one.
- Left TBDs in this file as I work out the codemelted_web module as this will be incorporated into my website.
- That will allow me to flesh this out in case I think of other use cases to add to this.

**26 Dec 2023:**
- Updated use case model to what I believe will be the use case organization.
- Documented all the sections of this document to tell the story.
- I am sure these will change as I start implementing each of the modules.
- Will also give thought as to what version 1 of this module will look like because I am not sure all of these will need defining to get to a version 1. We will see.

**23 Dec 2023:**

- Finalized design document to begin fleshing out this document.
- Stubbed all the different sections to begin filling it out.

## Module

```
X.Y.Z (dd mmm yyyy):
^ All module use cases are implemented
  ^ An individual use case becomes available or is tweaked significantly
    ^ Use case fixes / tweaks
```

As the CodeMelted modules are developed, they will be versioned as identified above. A use case is considered available when a sufficient portion of its functionality is developed, tested, and documented. This will reset the `.Z` for any fixes made to existing available module use cases. When everything is done with an identified major version, it will be released as `X.0.0` release. The highest version this should reach is `4.0.0` once all identified use cases are sufficiently developed.
