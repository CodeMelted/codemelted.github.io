"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995.  At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on premise servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code. Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.

Enter Progressive Web Applications (PWA). A technology stack that utilizes the web browser as the ultimate runtime environment. You can run your application so long as a web browser is on the device. This is the same mantra and spirit of the original Java slogan.

The goal of this project is to aid software engineers in building and delivering on PWAs. It will implement a series of identified use cases across the different identified SDK technologies to support all aspects of a PWA. The later sections of this document will expand on this philosophy.

# Version

## Document

**23 Dec 2023:**

- Finalized design document to begin fleshing out this document.
- Stubbed all the different sections to begin filling it out.

## Module

```
X.Y.Z (dd mmm yyyy):
^ All module use cases are implemented
  ^ An individual use case becomes available
    ^ Use case fixes / tweaks
```

As the CodeMelted modules are developed, they will be versioned as identified above. A use case is considered available when a sufficient portion of its functionality is developed, tested, and documented. This will reset the `.Z` for any fixes made to existing available module use cases. When everything is done, it will be released as `1.0.0`.

- *NOTE: The `2.0.0` version of any module is considered something outside this design document. It will be covered with a similar document as this if something is ever considered worthy* ðŸ™‚.
